         <p><b>Functions of Operating system-</b>
            Operating system performs three functions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Convenience:</b> 
                An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> Efficiency:</b>
                An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ability to Evolve:</b>
                An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <p>Operating system as User Interface –</p>
            <ol>
                <li>User</li>
                <li>System and application programs</li>
                <li>Operating system</li>
                <li>Hardware</li>
            </ol>
        
        
        <p>
            Every general-purpose computer consists of the hardware, operating system, system programs, and application programs. The hardware consists of memory, CPU, ALU, and I/O devices, peripheral device, and storage device. System program consists of compilers, loaders, editors, OS, etc. The application program consists of business programs, database programs.

       <p>Fig1: Conceptual view of a computer system<br>
           Every computer must have an operating system to run other programs. The operating system coordinates the use of the hardware among the various system programs and application programs for various users. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work.<br>

           The operating system is a set of special programs that run on a computer system that allows it to work properly. It performs basic tasks such as recognizing input from the keyboard, keeping track of files and directories on the disk, sending output to the display screen and controlling peripheral devices.
           OS is designed to serve two basic purposes:</p>
        
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                It controls the allocation and use of the computing System’s resources among the various user and tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                It provides an interface between the computer hardware and the programmer that simplifies and makes feasible for coding, creation, debugging of application programs.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <p>The Operating system must support the following tasks. The task are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Provides the facilities to create, modification of programs and data files using an editor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Access to the compiler for translating the user program from high level language to machine language.
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide a loader program to move the compiled program code to the computer’s memory for execution.

            </li>
            <li>
                Provide routines that handle the details of I/O programming.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
            
            
            
            
            
            <p> <b>*Important functions of an operating System:</b></p>
            
             <p>
                    <b>Security –</b><br>
                    The operating system uses password protection to protect user data and similar other techniques. it also prevents unauthorized access to programs and user data.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                    <b>Control over system performance –</b><br>
                    Monitors overall system health to help improve performance. records the response time between service requests and system response to have a complete view of the system health. This can help improve performance by providing important information needed to troubleshoot problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                    <b>Job accounting –</b><br>
                    Operating system Keeps track of time and resources used by various tasks and users, this information can be used to track resource usage for a particular user or group of user.
            </p>

            <p>
                    <b>Error detecting aids –</b><br>
                    Operating system constantly monitors the system to detect errors and avoid the malfunctioning of computer system.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Coordination between other software and users –</b><br>
                Operating systems also coordinate and assign interpreters, compilers, assemblers and other software to the various users of the computer systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Memory Management –</b><br>
                The operating system manages the Primary Memory or Main Memory. Main memory is made up of a large array of bytes or words where each byte or word is assigned a certain address. Main memory is a fast storage and it can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a program to be executed, it should be first loaded in the main memory. An Operating System performs the following activities for memory management:
                It keeps tracks of primary memory, i.e., which bytes of memory are used by which user program. The memory addresses that have already been allocated and the memory addresses of the memory that has not yet been used. In multi programming, the OS decides the order in which process are granted access to memory, and for how long. It Allocates the memory to a process when the process requests it and deallocates the memory when the process has terminated or is performing an I/O operation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Processor Management –</b><br>
                In a multi programming environment, the OS decides the order in which processes have access to the processor, and how much processing time each process has. This function of OS is called process scheduling. An Operating System performs the following activities for processor management.
                Keeps tracks of the status of processes. The program which perform this task is known as traffic controller. Allocates the CPU that is processor to a process. De-allocates processor when a process is no more required.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Device Management –</b><br>
                An OS manages device communication via their respective drivers. It performs the following activities for device management. Keeps tracks of all devices connected to system. designates a program responsible for every device known as the Input/Output controller. Decides which process gets access to a certain device and for how long. Allocates devices in an effective and efficient way. Deallocates devices when they are no longer required.
            </p>

            
            <p>
                <b>File Management –</b><br>
                A file system is organized into directories for efficient or easy navigation and usage. These directories may contain other directories and other files. An Operating System carries out the following file management activities. It keeps track of where information is stored, user access settings and status of every file and more… These facilities are collectively known as the file system.
