                An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.<br>
                An operating system is a software that manages the computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system.

        <p><b>Operating System</b> – Definition:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>
                    An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application  programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.

        <p><b>Types of Operating System –</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Batch Operating System- Sequence of jobs in a program on a computer without manual interventions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Time sharing operating System- allows many users to share the computer resources.(Max utilization of the resources).

                </li>
                <li>
                    Distributed operating System- Manages a group of different computers and make appear to be a single computer.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Network operating system- computers running in different operating system can participate in common network (It is used for security purpose).

                </li>
                <li>
                    Real time operating system – meant applications to fix the deadlines.
                </li> 
            </ul>
